# Solutions Repository

Here you will find all of the solutions to the individual and pair exercises that are assigned during the bootcamp.

The solutions will be posted on the day that the assignments are due (2nd business day after it was assigned).

You will have READ-only access to this repository and as such you will be able to *pull* updates but will not be able to *push* your own changes.

**To Pull Updates:** `git pull origin`
